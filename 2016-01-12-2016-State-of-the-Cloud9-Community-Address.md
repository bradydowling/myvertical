# 2016 State of the Cloud9 Community Address

Ladies and gentlemen of the Cloud9 community, we are thirteen days into the year 2016 and some recent changes are cause for reflection. In an effort to unify the community, the first ever Cloud9 State of the Community Address is now in session. Thank you for attending.

Today, after a breakthrough year for the Cloud9 Community, the forums are growing at a faster rate than ever before. (Applause.) With the emergence of the community, we saw many bright spots.

* Several Cloud9ers emerged as experts, helping other users as needed.

* Frequent questions and issues are now public knowledge for users to get instant answers.

* We saw tons of discussion around potential features and improvements.

Make no mistake, the Cloud9 community forums are brand new and change isn't easy. Common issues and bugs are open for all eyes to see, putting necessary pressure to keep Cloud9 in tip top shape. To address this, we now have a [common issues category](https://community.c9.io/c/common-issues). Here, users can see troubleshooting steps to take and we can get instant notifications about new reports that need to be handled quickly.

We also answered a few questions about the new [unlimited plans](https://c9.io/blog/unlimited-workspaces-for-premium-users/). To address many of these questions, we posted a [Cloud9 glossary of terms wiki](https://community.c9.io/t/cloud9-glossary-of-terms/637) so things start clear, and can remain clear, as further questions or changes arise.

With our successes and challenges in mind, let's look forward to a brighter future in the year 2016. Here are a couple things we’ll be focusing on as the Cloud9 community continues to grow.

### Order to the Community

We want to keep things organized with specific categories but we want to be sure not to jump to conclusions. We haven't quite narrowed down all the categories we want to use for topics but going forward we will have categories like "Support" and “Tutorials”. Those are working titles but when we do have this all nailed down, it will provide more structure and order to the community.

### Big Announcements

You may have noticed the [announcements category](https://community.c9.io/c/announcements) added to the mix a few weeks back. Things are looking a bit lonely there but that's only temporary. Going forward, we’ll post about experimental features, issues to know about, blog posts, and other goodies just for the Cloud9 community.

### More Growth

With the community in its infancy, there is much growth to be had. At the time of this writing there are 600 community members, 465 topics posted, and the average response time is 32.32 minutes. Here are a few more numbers you might find interesting:

* 1567 total posts (including replies)

* 313 likes

* 134 accepted solutions

* 52 feature requests

Moving forward, we'll see many more users, topics, and knowledge sharing in general. Certain posts will manifest themselves as the authoritative answer to a question, making it easier for Cloud9ers to find what they’re looking for faster. On top of that, we’ll see more announcements, tutorials, and goodies for users to feast on. (Applause.)

So with that all in mind, my fellow Cloud9ers, let's win the future. (Applause.) Make no mistake, it will not be easy, but with a unified community and Cloud9 IDE to stand on, we will do amazing things. Remember, we are greater together than we can ever be on our own. Thank you.
